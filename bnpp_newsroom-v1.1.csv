Radar waves : Used in naval and aeronautical security systems. Micro waves : Microwave ovens function due to these waves. Used in cellular phones. Infrared waves : Used in physiotherapy treatments. Used in sending signals by remote control devices and also in analytical work using spectroscopic methods. Visible waves : Vision and photography are due to waves in this range. Used in colorimetric analysis. Ultraviolet waves : Used for sterilization and to read confidential symbols in currency notes etc. Also used in spectroscopic analysis.  X- rays : Used  in X ray photography and in studies of  the structure of crystals etc. rays : Used in the treatment of cancer.']
